    "To look at the correlation between fluctuations in air traffic movements from Dutch airports and consumer spending, a correlation between datasets A, B, and C is tested. The variety of columns variables used in dataset A (cross country, local flights, amount of passengers and cargo) can be correlated to dataset B, C and D where the consumption expenditure of households is calculated by its different factors like domestic consumption, consumption of services by households, and consumption of goods. As all provided data sets work with a continuous scale based per quarter of a year , correlations can be tested and be visualised with graphs. \n",
